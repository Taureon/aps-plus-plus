discords probably more efficient tho
yes
ig so yeah
your typing speeds pretty good yeah, mines fairly fast but i always mispell words
:sob:
anywar
i used to feel the same about my voice until i just actually gave up trying to hide it and went with it
FRFRFRFRFRFRFRFRFR
SO TRU
yeah, they do
we should keep this commenting here forever lol
just incase some random person stumbles onto the project and sees this crazy lore
anyway
the first thing i should do is teach you what folders do what
nero is very organized in terms on file system
so it wont be confusing
wdym by split files
idk what splitting files mean so id assume no
no it doesnt have that but i think theres tab thingies on the top
awww thanks
is it because i keep misspelling words hahahaha you thought id do that twice heheheheheeh
i keep forgetting those are a thing lmao
i just type the whole words wdym how escape??
i used to do that all the time
if you put like special characters before the end of an html thing it does that
imma go eat a chicken burger hol up
im back
im not done eating
i just grabbed it and went back into my room
my typing speed is slower bc im eating with one hand
my keyboard is farther into my desk
